# java8QuickStart

This is a quick java6 to java8 refactor example live coded during a code dojo session in July 2016 as an introduction to some of Java8 new features.

Problem: filtering list of objects in a generic method that receives the predicate from the caller.

Folder structure:
* common: common classes
* step1: java6 style implementation with anonymous inner class
* step2: introduced Predicate functional interface and method reference
* step3: introduced lambda expression
* step4: introduced Streams
